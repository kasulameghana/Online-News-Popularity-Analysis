# Online-News-Popularity-Analysis Project Proposal

We will use the ‘Online News Popularity’ Data which outlines different set of features about articles that are published by the website Mashable.com in a period of two years. The current dataset represents the popularity of an article prior to its publication which we will analyze and compare several models on it. We have the data consisting 61 attributes where 58 are predictive attributes and 2 non-predictive and one target variable namely “Number of shares”. The total number of records is 39797.

The dataset features 60 attributes ranging from number of words in the title, number of links, keywords-best and worst, when was the article published, text subjectivity, use of negative words etc.  The whole data has numerical variables except URL which is the link of the article.

The project will be done using JMP Pro 12. We will follow this pipeline:

- Sample: Data sampling
- Explore: Discover relationships between the attributes, abnormalities if available, using data visualization.
- Modify: create and transform attributes
- Model: Apply different models to get desired outcome
- Assess: The evaluation of the models applied.

In this Project, we aim to find out the best model and predict the popularity of the online news by predicting the total number of shares before the article is published using different algorithms. The Algorithms will be ranging from various regressions to Random forest. Their performances will be recorded and compared. We will also focus on feature selection methods to improve performance of the model and reduce the overall cost.
